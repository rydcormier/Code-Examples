# Getting and Cleaning Data

The file run_analysis.R will download, parse, and analyze data involving *Human Activity Recognition*. The goal of the analysis
is to:
 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity   and each subject.

## Data set information
The data considered in this analysis has been collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, where the data was obtained :
