## My Code

Here is a sample of code I've written for courses I've taken over the last 
couple of years.

[bubble_detection.cpp](http://github.com/rydcormier)  
This program counts the number of bubbles&#8212;pairs of short, non-overlapping,  
disjoint paths between two vertices&#8212;on a De Bruijn graph constructed from   
the K-mers generated from a set of error-prone reads.

[clustering.cpp](http://github.com/rydcormier)  
This program takes a set of points and an integer k and partitions the set
set into k subsets and computes the minimum distance between any pair of
points in different clusters.

[cofiCostFunc.m](http://github.com/rydcormier)  
Implements a continuous differential multivarite objective function for 
collaborative filtering. Returns the value and the gradient. 

[nnCostFunction.m](http://github.com/rydcormier)  
A scalable objective function for classification neural networks. 

[phi_X174_error_free_overlap.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/)   
Assembles the phi X174 phage genome from 1618 simulated error free reads by   
constructing an overlap graph and finding a Hamiltonian path.

[phiX174_kmer.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier)    
This program assembles the phi X174 phage genome from its 10-mer composition
by constructing a De Bruijn graph and finding an Eulerian path. 

[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/rydcormier)  
An example of "tidy data"; This script downloads the 
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set]("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip") from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, merges the training and test
sets, extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation, descriptively
names the labels and feautures, and stores the data in a single object. The
[codebook](https://github.com/rydcormier) provides a more detailed description. 

[tip_removal.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier)  
This program simulates the task of tip removal on a De Bruign graph constructed   
from a set of error-prone reads.
